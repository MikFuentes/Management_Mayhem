19. and help transfer things from one station to the other using the conveyor belts. {Stage_Steps}
20. The Programs person delivers the items to the NPC in time and to act as the middle person between the two other players.
21. Do you want me to go over the stations and roles again? [21, 7]
22. Great! Your goal is to work together with your team to gather all the items that the NPC wants before the time runs out.
23. That’s the game in a nutshell! If you want a more detailed explanation you can view the Rules from the Main Menu {EMM}
24. Now before I let you go, here are a few more tips:
25. It's highly recommended for everyone to stay in their respective stations.
