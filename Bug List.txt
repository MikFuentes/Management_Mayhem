Bugs:

Major:
- Box sometimes doesn't get picked up on client?
- Box doesn't always return to drop point ***
- If the Host dc's, player's should be brought back to the main menu (after an error message)
- if the client dc's player's should be able to rejoin?
- Player sometimes walks backwards (maybe caused if the host doesn't move first?)

Minor:
- Jittery movement of pickups when being held --> Leads to hitbox/collision problems (e.g. exit trigger not working)
- UI elements anchoring is a lil weird when resizing
- No message for if host dc's
- Player sometimes walks backwards (maybe caused if the host doesn't move first?)
- NPC gameObject not finding the correct guy at player start
