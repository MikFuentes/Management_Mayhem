Bugs:

Major:
- Box moves on it's own when player is holding box near conveyer belt on client side (not server side). Probably related to how the player is holding the box.
- Box sometimes doesn't get picked up on client?
- Money is not synched when deposited

Minor:
- Client PlayerID is not synced onto the server when interacting with objects.
- UI elements anchoring is a lil weird when resizing
- No message for if host dc's
