Bugs:

Major:
- Box moves on it's own when player is holding box near conveyer belt on client side (not server side). Probably related to how the player is holding the box.

Minor:
- Client PlayerID is not synced onto the server when interacting with objects.
- UI elements anchoring is a lil weird
- Back button in the lobby doesn't bring back the landing page (commented out clearing of players)
- No message for if host dc's
