Bugs:

Major:
- https://forum.unity.com/threads/nullreferenceexception-when-passing-local-gameobjects-through-command-and-clientrpc-solved.509002/
- Box moves on it's own when player is holding box near conveyer belt on client side (not server side). Probably related to how the player is holding the box.
- Box sometimes doesn't get picked up on client?
- Box doesn't always return to drop point ***
- If the Host dc's, player's should be brought back to the main menu (after an error message)
- if the client dc's player's should be able to rejoin?

Minor:
- Client PlayerID is not synced onto the server when interacting with objects.
- UI elements anchoring is a lil weird when resizing
- No message for if host dc's
- Player sometimes walks backwards
